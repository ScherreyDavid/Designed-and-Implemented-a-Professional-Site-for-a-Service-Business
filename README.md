# Designed and Implemented a Professional Site for a Service Business

I developed a website for cleaning services that included new service offerings and specials, packaged solutions, and an image gallery to highlight the quality of the service. To improve communication with potential customers, I created a contact form that streamlined inquiries and requests. In addition, I optimized the website for search engines (SEO) to enhance its online visibility and attract more customers. My work contributed to the modernization of the business and its improved online presence, ultimately making it more accessible and engaging to potential customers.
